# cnc4free.org for gmax / CNC\_Toolkit methods and tutorials #

## Introduction ##

**cnc4free.org** began creating tutorials for gmax circa 2007, in it's Yahoo group incarnation.  As part of this work, tutorials were developed to illustrate simpler uses of CNC\_Toolkit.

Over time, **cnc4free.org** tutorial content developed into a 408 page ebook describing many techniques related to spline-shaping and toolpath creation. Spline-shaping abilities in the host software (3DSMAX, gmax,Viz) are essential for successful use of CNC\_Toolkit. Topics covered include a wide range of work for 3, 4 and 5 axis exploitation. Techniques address engraving, profiling, pocketing, relief and intaglio (V-Carving) toolpaths.


## Details ##

The goal of cnc4free.org is to increase awareness regarding tried and tested results using only FREE and LEGAL software / tools.  gmax has been tested to provide a highly integrated solution to address  2D, 2.5D and 3D CNC Tasks as described in the introduction.

Deriving gCode from designs created in gmax is an essential part of this process.  The ability to use CNC\_Toolkit sucessfully is therefore critical. **cnc4free.org** aims to explain existing techniques... and develop new methods to allow more CNC users to benefit from CNC\_Toolkit.  A primary goal is to convey the principles applied in toolpathing with CNC\_Toolkit.  An appreciation of the fundamental operating principles allows easier and far more successful work with the gmax / CNC\_Toolkit combination.

In addition to the above, work continues to apply scriptable gmax tools to spline-shaping / toolpathing.  Theoretically anything that can be done in the gmax view can be scripted.  It's hoped that some manual spline-shaping and intermediate path generation techniques, developed for work with CNC\_Toolkit can be scripted to allow more 'automatic' operation and setup.

Please feel free to download the current version of the  _'FREE Creative CNC Solution'_ ebook.  This is located in the 'Tutorials' area at http://cnc4free.org.  An **update** to the ebook to include new techniques and improvements is planned in the near future.

As always, I hope this helps.
